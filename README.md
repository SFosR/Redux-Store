# Redux Store

## User Story

AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

## Description

This was a refactoring assignment taking an e-commerce platform so that it used Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API. You'll find this app uses a Redux provider to access the React front end.
